## Who is him

Saul Goodman is a criminal lawyer who becomes involved with the main characters of the hit television show Breaking Bad. He is known for his flashy, over-the-top personality and his willingness to use unscrupulous tactics to get his clients out of trouble. Despite his questionable ethics, Saul is a skilled lawyer who is always ready to provide his clients with the legal representation they need, no matter how challenging the situation.

## Gradual transformation from a law-abiding citizen to a criminal mastermind

In Breaking Bad, Saul serves as the legal advisor to the show's main protagonist, Walter White, and his partner in crime, Jesse Pinkman. He helps them navigate the legal system as they become involved in the production and distribution of crystal methamphetamine. Saul is often portrayed as a comical character, with his exaggerated mannerisms and humorous one-liners providing a source of levity in the show's otherwise dark and intense storyline.

## Better Call Him

Saul Goodman is the central character of his own show, Better Call Saul, which explores his backstory and shows how he became the unscrupulous lawyer he is in Breaking Bad. In Better Call Saul, we see Saul before he adopts his alias, when he is still known as Jimmy McGill, a struggling small-time lawyer. The show chronicles Jimmy's rise to becoming Saul Goodman, showing how his experiences and relationships shaped the character we know from Breaking Bad. Like Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul is known for its high-quality writing, acting, and cinematography, and has become a critically acclaimed and popular show in its own right.
