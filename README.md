# Framework Frontend Practice

Collection of projects and landing pages that I have developed using various frontend frameworks and libraries.

## Frameworks

I am focusing on:

- React.js
- Next.js
- Bootstrap

## That's all folks... Wait

Find more of my projects in other repositories, such as:

- [My Frontend Mentor solutions](https://github.com/jvmdo/frontend-mentor-challenges)

- [My React Rocketseat's Ignite solutions](https://github.com/jvmdo/rocketseat-ignite)

- [My 30 days of React solutions](https://github.com/jvmdo/30-days-of-react)

- [My websites clones](https://github.com/jvmdo/clones-frontend-practice)

### TODO

Reorganize the repository in folder structure.

```bash
/
  -- React/
  -- Next/
  -- Tailwind/
  -- Bootstrap/
  -- ...
```
